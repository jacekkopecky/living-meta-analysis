# living-meta-analysis
A tool for supporting living and collaborative meta-analysis.

Todo this README should be about 'how to use this tool', 'what the benefits are', 'getting started guides/examples'. Possibly a small note about 'Developing LiMA' which can contain - datastore emulation, db dumps/restores and more; or those might be described in the deployment readme.

## Installation and Maintenance

See `deployment/README.md`.

## Testing

See `test/README.md`.
