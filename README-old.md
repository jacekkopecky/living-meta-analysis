# living-meta-analysis
A tool for supporting living and collaborative meta-analysis.

Todo this README should be about 'how to use this tool', 'what the benefits are', 'getting started guides/examples'. Possibly a small note about 'Developing LiMA' which can contain - datastore emulation, db dumps/restores and more; or those might be described in the deployment readme.

## Installation and Maintenance

See `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Testing

See `test/README.md`.

## Development

_todo this section is a stub_

to develop client-side, start the server with `npm run start:redirected` then all API calls will go to the live server

for development in REACT, use `npm run react-watch` for continuous building, and `npm run build` for the production build.
